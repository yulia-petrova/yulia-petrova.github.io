abstract: We discuss the centering operation for the Green Gaussian processes and calculate $L_2$-small ball asymptotics for some centered (demeaned) processes.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary:  We consider the problem of a small ball behavior in $L_2$-norm for some Gaussian processes of statistical interest.
