abstract: This article is a survey of the results on asymptotic behavior of small ball probabilities in $L_2$-norm. Recent progress in this field is mainly based on the methods of spectral theory of differential and integral operators.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary:  We consider the problem of a small ball behavior in $L_2$-norm for some Gaussian processes of statistical interest.
