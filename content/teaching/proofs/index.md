### Proofs from the BOOK

##### Talks:
The aim of the course is to enjoy the beauty of mathematical proofs in different areas: number theory, algebra, analysis etc. The main sourse of inspiration is THE BOOK by M. Aigner, G. Ziegler ``Proofs from the BOOK'', but as course go on we can find more interesting mathematical stories to tell. The idea is that students choose their favorite topic and give a presentation on it. Here is the list of the talks that we succeded to do this semester:
