I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.mat.puc-rio.br/) at [PUC-Rio](https://www.puc-rio.br/), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Broadly speaking, my research interests include PDEs and their applications to different fields: probability theory, fluid dynamics and solving real-world problems.

I did my postdoc at [Fluid dynamics Laboratory](https://fluid.impa.br/Home) at [IMPA](https://impa.br/en_US/), Rio de Janeiro, and my mentor is [Dan Marchesin](https://web.archive.org/web/20210815113601/https://marchesi.impa.br/Home). Before I was a researcher at [Chebyshev Laboratory of Mathematics & Computer Science department of St. Petersburg State University](https://chebyshev.spbu.ru/) involved in the lab's collaboration with petroleum company GazpromNeft.

I did my PhD under the supervision of Prof. [Alexander Nazarov](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Alexander-I-Nazarov-53574797) at the junction of probability theory and spectral theory. For the Russian version of PhD thesis see the [link](https://www.pdmi.ras.ru/pdmi/system/files/dissertations/dissertation_PETROVA_2018-07-09.pdf).
