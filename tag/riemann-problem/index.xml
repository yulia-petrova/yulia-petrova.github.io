Right now we are working on the non-uniqueness of vanishing viscosity admissible solutions for a Riemann problem for the system of conservation laws ($x\in\mathbb{R}$, $t&amp;gt;0$):
$$
s_t + f(s, c)_x = 0,
$$
$$
(cs + a(c))_t + (cf(s,c))_x = 0,
$$
with initial data $s(x,0)=c(x,0)=1$ for $x&amp;lt;0$ and $s(x,0)=s(x,0)=0$ for $x&amp;gt;0$. Here&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>$s=s(x,t)\in[0,1]$ is the water phase saturation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>$c=c(x,t)\in[0,1]$ is the concentration of the chemical agent in the water phase&lt;/li>
&lt;li>function $f(s,c)$ denotes the fractional flow of water (the Buckleyâ€“Leverett function)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>function $a(c)$ denotes the chemical&amp;rsquo;s adsorption on the rock&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It is commonly assumed that $f$ is an S-shaped function of $s$ for every $c$, and $a$ is an increasing concave function.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our aim is to prove that when the flow function depends non-monotonically on the concentration of chemicals, non classical shocks appear (undercompressive shocks/transitional waves), which depend on the ratio of dissipative coefficients, and cause non-uniqueness of solutions. Similar observation was made in a recent work by W. Shen (2017) and in a paper by Entov &amp;amp; Kerimov (1986) for different models of dissipation terms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the solution is found (and is unique), the next natural question is the stability of the solution under linear, nonlinear perturbations, and asymptotic stability as $t\to\infty$.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
