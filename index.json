The model consists of a system of advection-reaction-diffusion equations on concentration, velocity and pressure, describing motion of miscible liquids under the Darcy's law in two vertical tubes (real lines) and interflow between them. Our analysis reveals the structure of gravitational fingers in this simple setting - the mixing zone consists of space-time regions of constant intermediate concentrations and the profile of propagation is characterized by two consecutive traveling waves which we call a terrace. We prove the existence of such a propagating terrace for the parameters corresponding to small distances between the tubes. This solution shows the possible mechanism of slowing down the fingers' growth due to convection in the transversal direction. The main tool in the proof is a reduction to pressure-free transverse flow equilibrium (TFE) model using geometrical singular perturbation theory and the persistence of stable and unstable manifolds under small perturbations.","tags":[],"title":"Propagating terrace in a two-tubes model of gravitational fingering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Nazarov","Yulia Petrova"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"e8633dbc19605b29449ad209099d5aea","permalink":"https://yulia-petrova.github.io/publication/2023_l2-demeaned/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023_l2-demeaned/","section":"publication","summary":"We discuss the centering operation for the Green Gaussian processes and calculate $L_2$-small ball asymptotics for some centered (demeaned) processes.","tags":[],"title":"$L_2$-small ball asymptotics for some demeaned Gaussian processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fedor Bakharev","Aleksandr Enin","Yulia Petrova","Nikita Rastegaev"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1687996800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687996800,"objectID":"32e791d0e16138a9b34361c33423d0ea","permalink":"https://yulia-petrova.github.io/publication/2021_nonmonotonicity/","publishdate":"2023-06-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021_nonmonotonicity/","section":"publication","summary":"The solutions for a Riemann problem arising in chemical flooding models are studied using vanishing viscosity as an admissibility criterion.

Notwithstanding the realization of the solution by two computational schemes, the simulation results coincide with a sufficient accuracy.

Similar observation was made in a recent work by W. Shen (2017) and in a paper by Entov \u0026amp; Kerimov (1986) for different models of dissipation terms.\nAfter the solution is found (and is unique), the next natural question is the stability of the solution under linear, nonlinear perturbations, and asymptotic stability as $t\\to\\infty$.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b79e2b69745efdf5f10a3d23a87e6b4f","permalink":"https://yulia-petrova.github.io/project/conservation_laws/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/conservation_laws/","section":"project","summary":"Here is my research on conservation laws, mostly about the solution to a Riemann problem and stability analysis of the solutions.","tags":["Riemann problem","conservation laws","EOR"],"title":"Conservation laws","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"From 2017 till 2021 I was involved in the industrial collaboration with Russian petroleum company GazpromNeft.

If the experiment is done in a thin layer between two glasses, then it is called the Hele-Shaw cell. We consider the displacement of miscible and immiscible fluids in a porous medium. For the one-phase miscible displacement the governing equations are written as follows (the Peaceman model): $$ c_t + \\mathrm{div}(u\\cdot c)=\\varepsilon \\Delta c, $$ $$ u=-\\frac{k}{\\mu(c)}\\nabla p, $$ $$ \\mathrm{div}(u)=0. $$ Here the unknown functions are:\n $c=c(x,y,t)\\in[0,1]$ \u0026mdash; concentration of the more viscous fluid inside a less viscous fluid; $u=u(x,y,t)$ \u0026mdash; velocity of fluid; $p=p(x,y,t)$ \u0026mdash; pressure.  The function $\\mu(c)$ is the viscosity function and it\u0026rsquo;s inverse $m(c)=1/\\mu(c)$ is the mobility function. Imagine that the initial condition is a slightly perturbed Heavy-side function: $$ c(x,y,0) = \\mathbb{1}_{x\u0026gt;0} + \\eta, \\quad \\eta\\text{ is a small perturbation} $$ Then the instabilities (as in the picture above) will appear and we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of the solution $c$ as $t\\to\\infty$.\nThe experimental and numerical analysis shows the linear growth of the most \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;fastest\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; finger and the \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;slowest\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; finger.
